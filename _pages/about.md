</figure> 

*Croeso!* I'm an Astrophysics PhD Candidate at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) in Nashville, Tennessee (USA), where I study the nanohertz-frequency gravitational wave background. I'm also a Research Assistant for the [*North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational waves*](https://nanograv.org) (NANOGrav) and the [*International Pulsar Timing Array*](https://ipta4gw.org) (IPTA) Pulsar Timing Arrays, where I run their detection and characterisation pipelines and develop new methods to analyse our data.

My research interests include supermassive black hole binaries, cosmology, spectral characterisation, and Bayesian statistics.

I'm also committed to science communication and advocating for my community. I'm a former writer and current website chair for [Astrobites](https://www.astrobites.org), and I've recently started contributing to pulsar science articles on [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org). Outside of science, I'm a triathlete-in-training, swing dancer, reader, and music lover.
