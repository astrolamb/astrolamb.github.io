## I'm a Welsh Astrophysicist üî≠üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å∑Û†Å¨Û†Å≥Û†Åø

*Croeso!* I'm an Astrophysics PhD Candidate at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) in Nashville, Tennessee (USA), where I study the nanohertz-frequency gravitational wave background. I'm also a Research Assistant for the [*North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational waves*](https://nanograv.org) (NANOGrav) and [*International Pulsar Timing Array*](https://ipta4gw.org) (IPTA), where I run our detection and characterisation pipelines and I develop new methods to analyse our data.

My research interests include supermassive black hole binaries, cosmology, spectral characterisation, and Bayesian statistics. I developed [`ceffyl`](https://www.github.com/astrolamb/ceffyl/) - one of the engines behind the powerful [`PTArcade`](https://andrea-mitridate.github.io/PTArcade/) suite for new physics searches in pulsar timing array data.

I'm also committed to science communication and advocating for my community. I'm a former writer and current website chair for [Astrobites](https://www.astrobites.org), and I've recently started contributing to articles on [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org). Outside of science, I'm a triathlete-in-training, swing dancer, reader, and music lover.

I'm originally from Wales and my first language is *Cymraeg*.
